        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm a senior at New York University pursuing a major in computer science and a minor in bioinformatics. I'm
            driven by my desire to understand and pick apart how things work, from how different ingredients and
            chemical reactions work together to make one cohesive dish (why I like to cook) to how a multi-core
            computer divides tasks between its cores (why I took the course Parallel Programming).

                "This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the
                being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead
                of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote
                itself
                to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community, and as long as I live,
                it is my privilege to
                do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I
                live. Life is no 'brief candle' to me. It ia a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for a
                moment,
                and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to the future generations."

                "That work gave [Li Feifei] hope for how AI could evolve. It could be built to complement people's
                skills rather than simply replace them. If engineers would engage with people in other disciplines
                (even people in
                the real world!), they could make tools that expand human capacity, like automating time-consuming
                tasks to allow ICU nurses to spend more time with patients, rather than building AI, say, to automate
                someone's
                shopping experience and eliminate a cashier's job."

                    <br><br>
                    My friend Jinnu and I started working on Bridge at the <a

                        Makerthon</a> in early October to adress the issue of social
                    isolation among senior
                    adults. We came in runnerup in the competition with our initial prototype of an interest-focused,
                    activities-based, intergenerational matching platform. As a result, we were given the opportunity
                    to attend a series
                    of start-up bootcamps hosted by the NYU Entepreneurial Institute on customer discovery and
                    prototyping, and were invited to 1:1 weekly mentorship meetings with the E-Lab team. Through all of
                    this, we gained invaluable knowledge the lean startup process and how to iteratively approach our
                    solution and prototype. As a result, we've focused our solution after conducting dozens of user
                    interviews over the course
                    of the last month to specifically target connecting motivated students with old professionals to
                    foster mentorship
                    relationships. Furthermore, we decided to focus our efforts into matching pre-dental students and
                    older dentists for our
                    initial target market and are now talking to dentists to map out our initial screening and matching
                    parameters.

                <div class="hidden">
                    I wanted to participate in NYU's leadership program to more concretely understand the hazy concept
                    of "leadership" and what it involves on an actionable level. The experience was extremely
                    gratifying, teaching
                    me both the necessity of different types of leaders with their own strengths in a single group to
                    create a cohesive team, what my personal leadership strengths are, how to navigate conflicts within
                    a
                    group, and the different stages of team building. I learned to look at previous group conflicts in
                    a completely new light—one in individuals had their own independant values which may fatally clash
                    without a solid foundation of mutual trust and respect—and how to use my new knowledge to prevent
                    and
                    navigate future group conflicts—to focus on motivating and trust building in the initial stages of
                    a group
                    so everyone feels they can voice their opinions in a beneficial way.

                    <div class="clickArea">
                        <h4 class="spoiler">Individualization</h4>
                        <p class="hidden">Your Individualization theme leads you to be intrigued by the unique
                            qualities of each person. You are impatient with generalizations or "types" because you
                            don't want
                            to obscure what is special and distinct about each person. Instead, you focus on the
                            differences between individuals. You instinctively observe each person's style, each
                            person's motivation, how each thinks, and how each builds
                            relationships. You hear the one-of-a-kind stories in each person's life. This theme
                            explains why you pick your friends just the right birthday gift, why you know that one
                            person prefers praise in public and another detests it, and why you tailor your teaching
                            style to accommodate one person's need to be shown and another's desire to "figure it
                            out as I go." Because you are such a keen observer of other people's strengths, you can
                            draw out the best in
                            each person. This Individualization theme also helps you build productive teams. While some
                            search around for the perfect team "structure" or "process," you know instinctively
                            that the secret to great teams is casting by individual strengths so that everyone can do a
                            lot of what they do well.

                        <p class="hidden">The Strategic theme enables you to sort through the clutter and find the best
                            route. It is not a skill that can be taught. It is a distinct way of thinking, a special
                            perspective on the world at large. This perspective allows you to see patterns where
                            others simply see complexity. Mindful of these patterns, you play out alternative
                            scenarios, always asking, "What if
                            this happened? Okay, well what if this happened?" This recurring question helps you see
                            around
                            the next corner. There you can evaluate accurately the potential obstacles. Guided by where
                            you see
                            each path leading, you start to make selections. You discard the paths that lead nowhere.
                            You discard the paths that lead straight into resistance. You discard the paths that lead
                            into a fog of confusion. You cull and make
                            selections until you arrive at the chosen path—your strategy. Armed with your strategy,
                            you strike forward. This is your Strategic theme at work: "What if?" Select. Strike.

                        <p class="hidden">You see the potential in others. Very often, in fact, potential is all
                            you
                            see.
                            In your view no individual is fully formed. On the contrary, each individual is a work
                            in
                            progress, alive with possibilities. And you are drawn toward people for this very
                            reason.
                            When
                            you interact with others, your goal is to help them experience success. You look for
                            ways
                            to
                            challenge them.
                            You devise interesting experiences that can stretch them and help them grow. And all
                            the
                            while
                            you are on the lookout for the signs of growth—a new behavior learned or modified, a
                            slight
                            improvement in a skill, a glimpse of excellence or of "flow" where previously there
                            were
                            only
                            halting steps. For you these small increments—invisible to some—are clear signs of
                            potential
                            being realized.
                            These signs of growth in others are your fuel. They bring you strength and
                            satisfaction.
                            Over
                            time many will seek you out for help and encouragement because on some level they know
                            that
                            your helpfulness is both genuine and fulfilling to you.

                        <p class="hidden">Your Responsibility theme forces you to take psychological ownership for
                            anything
                            you commit to, and whether large or small, you feel emotionally bound to follow it
                            through
                            to
                            completion. Your good name depends on it. If for some reason you cannot deliver, you
                            automatically start to look for ways to make it up to the other person. Apologies are
                            not
                            enough. Excuses and rationalizations are totally unacceptable.
                            You will not quite be able to live with yourself until you have made restitution. This
                            conscientiousness, this near obsession for doing things right, and your impeccable
                            ethics,
                            combine to create your reputation: utterly dependable. When assigning new
                            responsibilities,
                            people will look to you first because they know it will get done. When people come to
                            you
                            for
                            help—and they soon will—you must be selective. Your willingness to volunteer may
                            sometimes
                            lead
                            you to take on more than you should.

                        <p class="hidden">Relator describes your attitude toward your relationships. In simple
                            terms,
                            the
                            Relator theme pulls you toward people you already know. You do not necessarily shy away
                            from
                            meeting new people—in fact, you may have other themes that cause you to enjoy the
                            thrill of
                            turning strangers into friends—but you do derive a great deal of pleasure and strength
                            from
                            being around your close friends. You are comfortable with intimacy.
                            Once the initial connection has been made, you deliberately encourage a deepening of
                            the
                            relationship. You want to understand their feelings, their goals, their fears, and
                            their
                            dreams; and you want them to understand yours. You know that this kind of closeness
                            implies
                            a
                            certain amount of risk—you might be taken advantage of—but you are willing to accept
                            that
                            risk.
                            For you a relationship has value only if it is genuine. And the only way to know that
                            is to
                            entrust yourself to the other person.
                            The more you share with each other, the more you risk together. The more you risk
                            together,
                            the
                            more each of you proves your caring is genuine. These are your steps toward real
                            friendship,
                            and you take them willingly.

                <div class="hidden">
                    I spent two years living in Shanghai when I was little, attending pre-school and kindergarten
                    there. While
                    I've long since returned to the US, I've developed an deep interest in Chinese culture, history,
                    and politics as a result of seeing how China is portrayed in American media and comparing that
                    image
                    with the one I had growing up.
                    Thus, I decided to apply to study abroad for a semester at Peking University (Bei Da) to take
                    courses
                    on the country's language, political history, and economic structure. These courses helped mesh
                    together
                    my understanding and personal experiences of China as a country as well as better analyze the
                    biases
                    behind the debate about China as a country from both sides.

                    My decision to pursue an internship experience at the Shanghai headquarters of the Bank of China
                    was
                    driven
                    by my desire to understand how banking systems function, and more specifically,
                    how the Chinese banking system functioned, similar to my reasonings behind studying at Peking
                    University.
                    While I was initially a little fearful of not fitting into Chinese corporate culture, my team and I
                    quickly
                    bonded over our mutual love of boba and good Shanghainese food.

                <div class="hidden">
                    I studied in Paris during their 2017 election cycle and lived a few blocks from the Bastille, where
                    multiple political protests happened. Needless to say, it was quite an interesting experience.
                    My favorite course was one on the tumultuous relationship between France and Islam from a
                    historical,
                    cultural, and political standpoint. Our class was just as much about the Crusades or French contact
                    with
                    the Ottoman Empire as it was about watching
                    the actual election debates play out between Le Pen, Macron, Melenchon, etc. We were fortunate
                    enough
                    to
                    have French ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy come in to talk to our class
                    about his policies and views relating to French Muslims like the infamous and controversial hijab
                    ban,
                    the
                    creation of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, as well as the Republic's stance on secularity
                    in
                    general.
                    Seeing the differences between politics in France and the US firsthand from stances on secularity
                    to
                    the
                    amount of screentime and advertisement for election candidates was of deep academic interest to me.
                    I also enjoyed Paris as a food and cultural capital, seeking out as many food places awarded with
                    the
                    <em>Meilleur
                        Ouvrir de France</em> as possible and going to the Louvre nearly every week.

                    I organized volunteering events alongside the club president by polling members on the types of
                    activities
                    they were most interested in. In doing so, we tried to make the experience something everyone felt
                    invested
                    in,
                    that everything we did was for causes that the club supported as one team. We ended up volunteering
                    at
                    a
                    school for children for cerebral palsy, senior retirement homes, and doing small things at school
                    to
